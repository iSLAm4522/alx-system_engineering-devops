## Task 0: OSI Model

### Objective
Understand the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, its purpose, and how it is organized.

### Questions and Answers
1. **What is the OSI model?**
   - **Answer**: The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology.

2. **How is the OSI model organized?**
   - **Answer**: From the lowest to the highest level.
